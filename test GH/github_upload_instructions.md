# GitHub Repository Upload Instructions

## Files to Upload to GitHub

Upload these files to your GitHub repository:

### Required Files:
1. `main.py` - Main Kivy application
2. `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
3. `app_config.json` - App configuration
4. `README.md` - Repository documentation

### GitHub Actions Setup:
1. Create folder: `.github/workflows/`
2. Upload `build.yml` to `.github/workflows/`

## Step-by-Step Process:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `yoga-belly-fat-app` (or your preferred name)
3. Make it Public or Private
4. Don't initialize with README (we'll upload our own)

### 2. Upload Files
**Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface**
1. Go to your new repository
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop all files from the package
4. Commit with message: "Initial commit - Yoga app files"

**Option B: Using Git Commands**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yoga-belly-fat-app.git
cd yoga-belly-fat-app
# Copy all files from the package here
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Yoga app files"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Verify GitHub Actions
1. Go to your repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. You should see the workflow running
4. Wait 10-15 minutes for build to complete

### 4. Download APK
1. In Actions tab, click on the completed workflow
2. Scroll down to "Artifacts"
3. Click "yoga-app-apk" to download
4. Install APK on your phone

## File Structure in Repository:
```
yoga-belly-fat-app/
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
├── app_config.json
├── README.md
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── build.yml
```

## Troubleshooting:
- If build fails, check the Actions logs
- Ensure all files are uploaded correctly
- Verify the workflow file is in the right location
- Check that the repository is public (for free GitHub Actions)

## Need Help?
- Check the build logs in Actions tab
- Verify all files are present in repository
- Ensure workflow file is properly named and located
