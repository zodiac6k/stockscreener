   - `main.py` (your mobile app)
   - `Yoga Poses/` folder (with all .jpg images)
   - `yoga_music/` folder (with Relax Music.mp3)

2. Click **"Upload to session storage"**
3. Upload your `yoga_app_files.zip` file
4. Wait for upload to complete

### Step 4: Install Buildozer
Copy and paste this code into the first cell:

```python
# Install buildozer and dependencies
!pip install buildozer
!pip install cython==0.29.33
!pip install kivy

# Install system dependencies
!apt-get update
!apt-get install -y \
    python3-pip \
    build-essential \
    git \
    python3 \
    python3-dev \
    ffmpeg \
    libsdl2-dev \
    libsdl2-image-dev \
    libsdl2-mixer-dev \
    libsdl2-ttf-dev \
    libportmidi-dev \
    libswscale-dev \
    libavformat-dev \

# Install Android SDK dependencies
!apt-get install -y \
    openjdk-8-jdk \
    autoconf \
    libtool \
    pkg-config \
    zlib1g-dev \
    libncurses5-dev \
    libncursesw5-dev \
    libtinfo5 \
    cmake

print("✅ Dependencies installed successfully!")
```

### Step 5: Extract Your Files
Copy and paste this code into the second cell:

```python
# Extract your uploaded files
import zipfile
import os

# Extract the ZIP file
with zipfile.ZipFile('yoga_app_files.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall('.')

# List extracted files
print("📁 Extracted files:")
for root, dirs, files in os.walk('.'):
    level = root.replace('.', '').count(os.sep)
    indent = ' ' * 2 * level
    print(f"{indent}{os.path.basename(root)}/")
    subindent = ' ' * 2 * (level + 1)
    for file in files:
        print(f"{subindent}{file}")

print("\n✅ Files extracted successfully!")
```

### Step 6: Configure Buildozer
Copy and paste this code into the third cell:

```python
# Initialize buildozer
!buildozer init

# Update buildozer.spec with our configuration
buildozer_config = '''
[app]
title = Yoga Belly Fat Loss
package.name = yogabellyfat
package.domain = org.yoga
source.dir = .
source.include_exts = py,png,jpg,kv,atlas,json,mp3,wav
source.include_patterns = Yoga Poses/*.jpg,yoga_music/*.mp3,yoga_music/*.json
version = 1.0
requirements = python3,kivy,requests,urllib3
orientation = portrait
fullscreen = 0
android.permissions = android.permission.INTERNET
android.api = 31
android.minapi = 21
android.ndk = 23b
android.ndk_api = 21
android.private_storage = True
android.accept_sdk_license = True
android.allow_backup = True
'''

# Write the configuration
with open('buildozer.spec', 'w') as f:
    f.write(buildozer_config)

print("✅ Buildozer configured successfully!")
```

### Step 7: Build the APK
Copy and paste this code into the fourth cell:

```python
# Build the APK (this will take 10-15 minutes)
print("🔨 Starting APK build...")
print("⏳ This will take 10-15 minutes. Please wait...")

!buildozer android debug

print("✅ APK build completed!")
```

### Step 8: Download the APK
Copy and paste this code into the fifth cell:

```python
# Check if APK was created
import os

apk_path = None
for root, dirs, files in os.walk('.'):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith('.apk'):
            apk_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            break
    if apk_path:
        break

if apk_path:
    print(f"🎉 APK created successfully!")
    print(f"📁 Location: {apk_path}")
    print(f"📏 Size: {os.path.getsize(apk_path) / (1024*1024):.1f} MB")
    
    # Create download link
    from google.colab import files
    files.download(apk_path)
else:
    print("❌ APK not found. Check the build logs above for errors.")
```
